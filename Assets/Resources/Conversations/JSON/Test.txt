PLAYER:: Eleanor? Is that really you?
ELEANOR:: Alex, it's been too long! You look... good.
PLAYER:: You too, Eleanor. Please, have a seat.
ELEANOR:: Alex, I'm so glad you agreed to meet me.
I know it's been ages, but I needed to talk to someone outside of... all this.
PLAYER:: I figured something must be up. You sound serious.
ELEANOR:: It's my job, Alex. It's become all-consuming. I used to be so ambitious, so excited about making a difference. 
But now, I'm not sure if I'm making the right choices anymore.
PLAYER:: Eleanor, you've always been passionate about your work. What's changed?
ELEANOR:: I've seen too much, Alex. The complexities of my position, the compromises I've had to make...
it's left me questioning everything.
I want a life beyond this, but I'm terrified that if I step back, people will get hurt.
it's eating away at me. I can't keep up this façade forever.
PLAYER:: Eleanor, you've always been the one who held it together, but it's okay to show vulnerability. 
We all have our breaking points.
ELEANOR:: I know, but it's not just about me. I've built connections, relationships, responsibilities.
People rely on me, and I can't let them down.
PLAYER:: Finding a balance won't be easy, but it's necessary.
You can't pour from an empty cup, Eleanor.
ELEANOR:: I don't want to let anyone down, Alex, but I also don't want to lose myself in the process.
PLAYER:: You won't lose yourself, Eleanor.
You've always been strong, and you have the power to make the changes you need. 
It's about finding the right balance for you, not just for everyone else.
ELEANOR:: Thank you, Alex. Your support means the world to me.
